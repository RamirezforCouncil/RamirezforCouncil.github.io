      <h1>Helpful Resources</h1>

      <p class="description">
       There are many City of Mountain View departments, divisions, and services, and it can be challenging to find the resource that you need. Additionally, there are other governmental agencies and organizations that serve Mountain View residents. This is an ongoing project and will take some time to complete. If you have any requests or recommendations for additional resources to include, please email me at <a href="mailto:lucas@ramirezforcouncil.com" target="_blank">lucas@ramirezforcouncil.com</a> or <a href="https://github.com/RamirezforCouncil/RamirezforCouncil.github.io" target="_blank">submit a pull request or issue through GitHub</a>.
