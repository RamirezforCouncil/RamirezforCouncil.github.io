      <h4 id="eviction" data-magellan-target="eviction">Eviction Moratorium</h4>
	  <div class="inner">
	  <p>In August, the Mountain View City Council extended and strengthened the eviction moratorium. The eviction moratorium will now protect renters who are economically impacted by COVID-19 for the next several months, aligning with Santa Clara County’s eviction moratorium. Previously, the City’s eviction moratorium was scheduled to end on Monday, August 31. </p>
	  <p>The most significant changes include the following: 
	  <ul>
	  <li>Extension of the eviction moratorium to align with the County. </li>
	  <li>Increase the repayment period to align with the County. Full repayment of back rent is now required within 12 months of the expiration of the moratorium, with at least 50% due at 6 months following the expiration. (Previously, full repayment was required 180 days following the expiration of the moratorium.) </li>
	  <li>Allocation of an additional $100,000 to CSA for the rent relief program.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

	  <p><b>Caltrain Updates </b></p>
	  <p>Caltrain to Implement Additional Weekday Service Reductions </p>
	  <p>Due to significant reductions in ridership resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Caltrain will further reduce weekday train service indefinitely starting Monday, March 30. </p>
	  <p>The modified weekday schedule will operate 42 trains per day, rather than the usual 92. Trains will make all local weekday stops between San Jose and San Francisco every 30-60 minutes, depending on time of day. Caltrain will continue operating two Gilroy service trains during the morning and afternoon peak commute. Limited and Baby Bullet service will be suspended until further notice. </p>
	  <p>The updated weekday schedule will be available at <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/" target="_blank">www.caltrain.com</a>. </p>
	  <p>Weekend service will continue to operate normally. </p>
	  <p>These additional schedule reductions are necessary to mitigate severe fare revenue losses while still providing essential transit services to all stations along Caltrain’s corridor. Caltrain is monitoring ridership during this time and may implement additional service changes as needed while ensuring that riders can maintain social distancing in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html" target="_blank">recommendations</a>. Caltrain continues to maintain daily onboard cleaning and sanitation protocols in compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines. </p>
	  <p>Caltrain is assessing the impact that reduced ridership is having on the agency’s ability to maintain operations in the coming months. One-way and Day Pass ticket sales have declined by approximately 86% from levels prior to the current health crisis. On the first day of the Bay Area-wide Public Health Order, Caltrain recorded a 95% decrease in average daily ticket sales. With no other dedicated source of funding, Caltrain relies on fares to cover 70% of the system’s operating costs. </p>
	  <p>Due to severe ridership declines as a result of the public health order, transit agencies, like Caltrain, are now experiencing serious financial challenges. Federal legislation has been approved that could provide transit agencies throughout the country with funding to maintain operations. Caltrain is working with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to determine how those funds will be allocated throughout the Bay Area. </p>
	  <p>For more information about Caltrain schedules and fares or for help planning your trip, call Caltrain Customer Service at 1.800.660.4287 (TTY 650.508.6448) or visit <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/" target="_blank">www.caltrain.com</a>. </p>

		<p>On weekends and holidays, callers can leave a detailed message and staff will return the call during the next business day. Shelter placements for homeless individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 will still be performed on weekends.

Please share this new number with any clients and community members. Remember that the program will go for six weeks and the hotline is being staffed 12 hours a day for 6 days a week. So if someone doesn't get through at first, they ask people to be patient and try later. they won't be able to help everyone, but will be able to continue helping people throughout the six weeks. <a href="https://www.catholiccharitiesscc.org/drai" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.

	  <div class="inner">
	  <p>The County would like to acknowledge that as new directives and updates are being provided by our health officials about COVID-19, a natural reaction may be to worry, which may leave us feeling vulnerable and helpless. In addition to following the advice and orders of our Public Health Officer, here are some tips to help you practice self-care during this time: ​</p>
	  <p>
	  <ol>
	  <li><b>Healthy habits.</b> While this may seem simple, any health care provider will tell you that getting good sleep, eating healthy, drinking plenty of water and exercising regularly can help boost your immune system. Consider our Public Health Officer’s guidance and practice social distancing while taking care of your physical and mental health.</li>
	  <li>Digital detox. Continuous watching or listening to media reports, reading online news or social media can lead to unintended fear and anxiety. Try to limit your intake of news to a couple of key reliable sources and remember to check our <a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/DiseaseInformation/novel-coronavirus/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Public Health Department</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> websites for key COVID-19 updates. </li>
	  <li><b>Mindfulness.</b> Being present and living in the moment can help you reduce anxiety. If you need help calming your mind, try listening to mindfulness apps or listening to visualization resources. And, remember to access your health plan’s mental health and behavioral health services if you start to feel overwhelmed. Mental health and behavioral health providers are essential services.</li>
	  <li><b>Hand awareness.</b> In addition to frequent <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html" target="_blank">proper handwashing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC5W4yMCcdo&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">be aware of what you touch</a>, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Fhome%2Fcleaning-disinfection.html" target="_blank">clean and disinfect</a> throughout the day since your hands are a key way germs get into our body. </li>
		<li><b>Normalize new salutations.</b> Elbow bumps, a head nod, a virtual high five or a nice smile are the new ways to greet others without having to shake hands. Give it a try and others will appreciate your thoughtfulness. </li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p>While this is not meant to be an all-inclusive list, these tips will hopefully provide some actions you can control during this time.​ </p>
