<h2>Newspapers </h2>
<p>"We appreciate Ramirez' passionate approach to R3 zoning changes and anti-displacement work... He also has a clear understanding of what it takes to get affordable housing built in Mountain View, and the various routes the city can take to dig up enough funding to get these expensive, deed-restricted units built... Vote for experience this November by returning Kamei, Hicks and Ramirez to the Mountain View City Council." <br>-<a href="https://www.mv-voice.com/news/2022/10/14/head-editorial-reelect-hicks-kamei-and-ramirez-to-mountain-view-city-council" target="_blank">Mountain View Voice</a><br>
“Ramirez, a policy analyst for the city of San Jose, is laser-focused on maximizing the number of affordable housing units in Mountain View. He is well-versed on land-use issues and the impact of state laws on cities. And like Hicks and Kamei, Ramirez is a good listener who has helped create a congenial atmosphere on the City Council... Mountain View voters should give them another four years on the City Council.” <br>-<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/09/28/editorial-in-mountain-view-reelect-incumbents-hicks-kamei-ramirez/" target="_blank">Mercury News</a> <br>
“The city needs proven experience and expertise to continue moving forward. With this in mind, we are endorsing incumbents Lucas Ramirez, Alison Hicks and Ellen Kamei. All three are effective and have served on a council that works well together. All bring unique and necessary skill sets. Ramirez, the current mayor, lives and breathes governance and policy making... He is analytical, yet also quietly passionate about public service.” <br>-
