	  <br><p>Friends,</p>
	  <p>As a Mountain View native, I have been fortunate to enjoy everything that makes our city an extraordinary place to live: its history, diversity, inclusivity, and innovation. We are blessed with a vibrant downtown, wonderful parks and open space, safe neighborhoods, and a thriving economy. People from around the world come here for the opportunity to enjoy all of the great things our city has to offer.</p>
	  <p>However, Mountain View faces several challenges that erode the opportunity for both longtime residents and those new to our community to experience this city the way I have. The housing affordability crisis and severe traffic congestion in particular threaten the long-term health of our city.</p>
	  <p>I value community stability and diversity, and I will fight to prevent the displacement of longtime residents. For our community to remain strong, seniors with fixed incomes must have the opportunity to downsize or age in place. Young professionals must have the opportunity to raise their families here. I value environmental sustainability and economic prosperity, and I support land use policy that complements transit and other alternative modes of transportation. Residents and commuters alike cannot afford to waste countless hours stuck in gridlock. Schools, City Hall, and businesses must be able to remain competitive and attract and retain talented employees.</p>
	  <p>As the chair of the Human Relations Commission, a member of the VTA 2000 Measure A Citizens Watchdog Committee/Citizens Advisory Committee, and a longtime City Council observer, I have a deep understanding of local government and the issues facing the city. I am prepared to take on major challenges like the jobs/housing imbalance. I will promote policies that will increase the amount of affordable housing in Mountain View, and I will work to improve the safety, reliability, and convenience of alternative modes of transportation. I also will expand opportunities for civic engagement and resident participation in critical decision-making.</p>
	  <p>I would be honored to serve you on the City Council, and I look forward to working hard to earn your vote.</p>
	  <p> - Lucas Ramirez</p>
