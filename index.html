	      <br><p>Dear Friends,</p>

        <p>I want to express my sincere gratitude for all of the support you have given me. It takes a village to run a campaign. From knocking on doors and speaking to your neighbors and friends to putting up yard signs, you have helped me immensely.</b></p>
		
		<p>Four years ago, I ran for Mountain View City Council to address the housing crisis, protect renters from displacement, improve bicycle and pedestrian safety, and help make local government more accessible and responsive to residents. With the support of the voters, that campaign was successful, and I have been blessed to serve our community – my hometown – as a Councilmember and, in 2022, as Mayor. </p>
		
		<p>During my first term, we faced a global pandemic that significantly impacted the health and economic wellbeing of many residents. Our response included adopting an eviction moratorium, opening the North County vaccination clinic, and leveraging federal funds to provide loans for local small businesses and direct financial assistance to vulnerable families. In collaboration with my colleagues on the City Council, our stellar municipal employees, and our representatives at other levels of government, we have accomplished a lot, but much more work remains.  </p>
		
		<p> Together, we can continue that work to ensure Mountain View remains a thriving and socio-economically diverse community that is accessible to all. </p>
		
		<p><b>In 2022, I succesfully ran for re-election. I could not have done it without you. Thank you for making this possible! It truly has been an honor and a privilege to serve you on the Mountain View City Council. I am grateful to have this opportunity to work with you to address the challenges facing our community and to preserve the high quality of life that we enjoy. </b></p>

        <p>Remaining accessible to you and promoting public participation in local government are among my top priorities. Now that the campaign is over, this website converted from its campaign use to host key resources and updates to help inform and engage residents and stakeholders. By hosting it on GitHub, I hope to encourage the community to utilize it as a dynamic platform and modify it to ensure that it provides the most useful and up-to-date information.</p>
