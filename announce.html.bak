      <h4 id="moratorium" data-magellan-target="moratorium">Statewide Eviction Moratorium and Rent Relief</h4>
      <div class="inner">
          <p> On January 29, the State of California adopted legislation (SB 91) that extends the Tenant, Homeowner, and Small Landlord Relief Act (AB 3088). SB 91’s Tenant Relief Act extends eviction protections for tenants experiencing COVID-19 financial hardship effective immediately. All residential properties in Mountain View are covered, including single-family homes, condos/townhomes, duplexes, apartments, mobile homes and mobile home spaces and other types of residential rental units. </p>
		  <p>SB 91 also provides financial assistance to tenants and small property owners impacted by COVID-19. The application for California tenants and landlords is available at <a href="https://housing.ca.gov/covid_rr/" target="_blank">housing.ca.gov</a>. A list of supporting organizations and their contact information are available on <a href="https://housing.ca.gov/covid_rr/partner_resources.html" target="_blank">that site</a>. The list includes community organizations in each county that are available to help with applications. </p>
		  <p>Tenants are protected by, and tenants and landlords must follow, the State’s eviction moratorium requirements. It is important that tenants and landlords know that the State law has different noticing and past-due rent repayment requirements than the City’s previous law. Up-to-date online forms and information are now available at <a href="http://MountainView.gov/EvictionRelief" target="_blank">MountainView.gov/EvictionRelief</a>. </p>
		  <p>The City also hosts weekly webinars to inform the community about the eviction moratorium. To register in advance please visit: <a href="http://mountainview.gov/emwebinars" target="_blank">mountainview.gov/emwebinars</a> </p>
		  <p>If you need assistance or would like to learn more about the eviction moratorium, please contact the Mountain View Rental Housing Helpline by emailing <a href="mailto:csfra@housing.org" target="_blank">csfra@housing.org</a> or calling <a href="tel:6502822514" target="_blank">(650) 282-2514</a>. </p>
		  <p>The City of Mountain View Rent Relief Program provides financial assistance to qualifying tenants impacted by COVID-19. Rent relief is available for tenants who qualify. Please contact the Community Services Agency to learn more by visiting <a href="http://csacares.org" target="_blank">csacares.org</a>, emailing <a href="mailto:renthelp@csacares.org" target="_blank">renthelp@csacares.org</a> or calling <a href="tel:6509680836" target="_blank">650-968-0836</a>. </p>
