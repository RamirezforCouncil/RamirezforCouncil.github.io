	  <p>Caltrain <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/about/MediaRelations/news/Caltrain_to_Adjust_Service_in_Response_to_Significantly_Lower_Ridership.html" target="_blank">announced Friday</a> that peak-hour service will be reduced starting Tuesday, March 17. With so many companies and businesses asking commuters to stay home, Caltrain ridership has declined dramatically. Reducing service is necessary to control costs. Caltrain does not have a dedicated source of revenue and relies on fares to cover 70% of its budget.

      <h4 id="tips" data-magellan-target="tips">Tips to Stay Healthy</h4>
	  <div class="inner">
	  <p>The County would like to acknowledge that as new directives and updates are being provided by our health officials about COVID-19, a natural reaction may be to worry, which may leave us feeling vulnerable and helpless. In addition to following the advice and orders of our Public Health Officer, here are some tips to help you practice self-care during this time: ​</p>
	  <p>
	  <ol>
	  <li><b>Healthy habits.</b> While this may seem simple, any health care provider will tell you that getting good sleep, eating healthy, drinking plenty of water and exercising regularly can help boost your immune system. Consider our Public Health Officer’s guidance and practice social distancing while taking care of your physical and mental health.</li>
	  <li>Digital detox. Continuous watching or listening to media reports, reading online news or social media can lead to unintended fear and anxiety. Try to limit your intake of news to a couple of key reliable sources and remember to check our <a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/DiseaseInformation/novel-coronavirus/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Public Health Department</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> websites for key COVID-19 updates. </li>
	  <li><b>Mindfulness.</b> Being present and living in the moment can help you reduce anxiety. If you need help calming your mind, try listening to mindfulness apps or listening to visualization resources. And, remember to access your health plan’s mental health and behavioral health services if you start to feel overwhelmed. Mental health and behavioral health providers are essential services.</li>
	  <li><b>Hand awareness.</b> In addition to frequent <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html" target="_blank">proper handwashing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC5W4yMCcdo&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">be aware of what you touch</a>, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Fhome%2Fcleaning-disinfection.html" target="_blank">clean and disinfect</a> throughout the day since your hands are a key way germs get into our body. </li>
		<li><b>Normalize new salutations.</b> Elbow bumps, a head nod, a virtual high five or a nice smile are the new ways to greet others without having to shake hands. Give it a try and others will appreciate your thoughtfulness. </li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p>While this is not meant to be an all-inclusive list, these tips will hopefully provide some actions you can control during this time.​ </p>

		<h4 id="caltrain">Caltrain Electrification</h4>
		<p>In Summer 2018, Caltrain began performing work along the railroad corridor in Mountain View. </p>
		<p>The activities during this time included locating underground utilities, testing soil conditions, inspecting signal/communication equipment, potholing, and pruning/removing trees in preparation for the installation and operation of the Overhead Contact System that will power electric trains. </p>
		<p>Caltrain crews will be extending the existing set-out track approximately 500 feet in order to accommodate on-track equipment required for Caltrain Electrification.  The current set-out track is between Farley Street and South Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View.  Construction will require a staging area for foundation installation, pole installation, construction material and pole delivery and storage as well as for loading and unloading of train cars. The loading and unloading of construction train cars and equipment will require the use of trucks, loading of construction trains and occasional use of backup alarms. Staging is expected to begin in October 2019 with construction occurring over a 8-12 month period. </p>
		<p>Vehicles will enter the staging area off of Central Expressway at Farley Street.  Egress will occur south of South Shoreline Boulevard back onto the Central Expressway. </p>.

		<h4 id="stateleg">New State Legislation</h4>
		<p>The California state legislature has adopted several bills that went into effect on January 1, 2020. A nice summary of several new laws is <a href="https://laist.com/2019/12/27/californias_new_laws_starting_jan_1_2020.php" target="_blank">available here</a>. </p>
		<p>Many of these laws are quite consequential, but particularly noteworthy are AB 1482 and SB 329. AB 1482 enacts a statewide rent cap (allowing annual rent increases no greater than 5% plus inflation) and prohibits landlords from evicting tenants without just cause. <b>It is important to keep in mind that the state law allow cities to enact stronger renter protections.</b> Renters in the City of Mountain View are protected by the Community Stabilization and Fair Rent Act (CSFRA), also known as Measure V. <a href="https://www.mountainview.gov/depts/comdev/preservation/rentstabilization/default.asp" target="_blank">More information about CSFRA is available here.</a> </p>
		<p>SB 329 prohibits discrimination against tenants with housing vouchers.</p>
