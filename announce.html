          <p>In keeping with our city's convention, I won't be endorsing any candidate for Council, nor will I attend any events organized by any Council campaign. However, I recognize that the pandemic impedes the ability to reach out to voters individually, and I know many residents appreciate the opportunity to meet candidates in person and ask questions. Therefore, I have offered to the candidates to share any meet-and-greets on this page and through my other communication channels.  </p>

      <h4 id="grandjury" data-magellan-target="grandjury">Court Seeks Candidates for Public Watchdog Agency </h4>
      <div class="inner">
          <p><b>Recruitment begins for 2021 Civil Grand Jury panel </b></p>
		  <p>Presiding Judge Deborah A. Ryan has announced that the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, is seeking volunteers to serve on the 2021 Civil Grand Jury. </p>
		  <p>The Civil Grand Jury, an arm of the Superior Court, is a part of the judicial branch of government. It serves as the county’s civil watchdog agency and may examine all aspects of county and city government, special districts, and school districts. It is authorized to inspect and audit books, records, and financial expenditures, to ensure accountability of public funds. The Grand Jury may also inspect jails and juvenile detention facilities. <p>
		  <p>Grand Jury service affords citizens the unique opportunity to contribute to the efficiency of local government and play an integral part in ensuring that government officials are accountable to residents. Applicants must be 18 years of age or older, United States citizens, and residents of Santa Clara County. Service on the grand jury does require a time commitment of an average of 25 hours per week, or as determined by the Grand Jury. </p>
		  <p>Due to the challenges posed by the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and in line with California Penal Code §905.5(b), the Court determined it is in the best interest of the institution of the Civil Grand Jury to transition from a fiscal year term to a calendar year term. This change was considered and approved by the County Board of Supervisors and has necessitated that the next term of the Civil Grand Jury begins on January 4, 2021. </p>
		  <p>Additionally, the Civil Grand Jury Ceremony to honor and discharge the 2019-2020 Civil Grand Jury, and impanel the newly selected 2021 Civil Grand Jury, has been rescheduled to Thursday, December 17, 2020, at 4 pm, and will be held remotely. </p>
		  <p>Persons interested in applying may obtain an application online at <a href="https://www.scscourt.org/" target="_blank">www.scscourt.org</a> under “Civil Grand Jury”. Questions may also be directed to Britney Huelbig, Deputy Manager for the Civil Grand Jury, at 408-882-2721 or <a href="mailto:CGJ@scscourt.org" target="_blank">CGJ@scscourt.org</a>. </p>

		<h4 id="caltrain">Caltrain Electrification</h4>
		<p>In Summer 2018, Caltrain began performing work along the railroad corridor in Mountain View. </p>
		<p>The activities during this time included locating underground utilities, testing soil conditions, inspecting signal/communication equipment, potholing, and pruning/removing trees in preparation for the installation and operation of the Overhead Contact System that will power electric trains. </p>
		<p>Caltrain crews will be extending the existing set-out track approximately 500 feet in order to accommodate on-track equipment required for Caltrain Electrification.  The current set-out track is between Farley Street and South Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View.  Construction will require a staging area for foundation installation, pole installation, construction material and pole delivery and storage as well as for loading and unloading of train cars. The loading and unloading of construction train cars and equipment will require the use of trucks, loading of construction trains and occasional use of backup alarms. Staging is expected to begin in October 2019 with construction occurring over a 8-12 month period. </p>
		<p>Vehicles will enter the staging area off of Central Expressway at Farley Street.  Egress will occur south of South Shoreline Boulevard back onto the Central Expressway. </p>.
