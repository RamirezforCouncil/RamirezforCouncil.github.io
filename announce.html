		<h4 id="plan">City of Mountain View Consolidated Plan Update: Request for Input</h4>
		<p>Public participation is central to the development of the City of Mountain View’s Consolidated Plan. We are working collaboratively with the County of Santa Clara to help identify affordable housing, homeless and community improvement needs over the next five years. </p>
		<p>The City of Mountain View is in the process of updating its Consolidated Plan that identifies spending priorities for federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME program funds that the City receives. This most recent update will cover the years 2020-2025 and will prioritize the needs of the community’s low and moderate income population. As part of the Consolidated Plan update, the City will also be preparing a plan to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing (AFFH), which will identify current obstacles to ensuring fair housing opportunities in Mountain View, establish how the City plans to reduce these obstacles, and track progress towards improving fair housing access. </p>

		<h4 id="caltrain">Caltrain Electification</h4>
		<p>In Summer 2018, Caltrain began performing work along the railroad corridor in Mountain View. </p>
		<p>The activities during this time included locating underground utilities, testing soil conditions, inspecting signal/communication equipment, potholing, and pruning/removing trees in preparation for the installation and operation of the Overhead Contact System that will power electric trains. </p>
		<p>Caltrain crews will be extending the existing set-out track approximately 500 feet in order to accommodate on-track equipment required for Caltrain Electrification.  The current set-out track is between Farley Street and South Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View.  Construction will require a staging area for foundation installation, pole installation, construction material and pole delivery and storage as well as for loading and unloading of train cars. The loading and unloading of construction train cars and equipment will require the use of trucks, loading of construction trains and occasional use of backup alarms. Staging is expected to begin in October 2019 with construction occurring over a 8-12 month period. </p>
		<p>Vehicles will enter the staging area off of Central Expressway at Farley Street.  Egress will occur south of South Shoreline Boulevard back onto the Central Expressway. </p>.
