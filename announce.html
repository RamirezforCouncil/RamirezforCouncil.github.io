      <h4 id="chamber" data-magellan-target="chamber">Mountain View Marketplace </h4>
      <div class="inner">
          <p> The Mountain View Chamber of Commerce and the City of Mountain View have launched <a href="https://shop.ilovemv.org/businesses" target="_blank">The Mountain View Marketplace</a>, a new online shopping portal designed specifically to promote local businesses and make it easier to shop at them. With the new health restrictions in place for Santa Clara County, the need for e-commerce solutions is even stronger. </p>
		  <p>Over 110 businesses are already a part of the Marketplace, which is free to all businesses. Restaurants, cafes, retail stores, personal care salons, fitness studios, repair services, and many others are represented from all across the city. New merchants are continually being added, and they are welcome to <a href="https://shop.ilovemv.org/sign-up/" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. </p>
		  <p>While the portal is being launched to help with an immediate crisis, it will be an ongoing service to businesses and the community. It can be easily curated based on the season, events, and happenings. </p>
		  <p>Please tell your friends, post on social media, and email your personal networks. The Chamber also will have lawn signs available soon that promote "Shop Safe - Shop Local" and the Marketplace URL. Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@ilovemv.org" target="_blank">support@ilovemv.org</a> if you'd like one. </p>
		  <p>Creation of the shopping portal has been funded, in part, by a grant from Google to support Mountain View small and medium size businesses. In March, Google committed a $400,000 grant to help provide relief for small businesses in Mountain View that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you! </p>

		<h4 id="caltrain">Caltrain Electrification</h4>
		<p>In Summer 2018, Caltrain began performing work along the railroad corridor in Mountain View. </p>
		<p>The activities during this time included locating underground utilities, testing soil conditions, inspecting signal/communication equipment, potholing, and pruning/removing trees in preparation for the installation and operation of the Overhead Contact System that will power electric trains. </p>
		<p>Caltrain crews will be extending the existing set-out track approximately 500 feet in order to accommodate on-track equipment required for Caltrain Electrification.  The current set-out track is between Farley Street and South Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View.  Construction will require a staging area for foundation installation, pole installation, construction material and pole delivery and storage as well as for loading and unloading of train cars. The loading and unloading of construction train cars and equipment will require the use of trucks, loading of construction trains and occasional use of backup alarms. Staging is expected to begin in October 2019 with construction occurring over a 8-12 month period. </p>
		<p>Vehicles will enter the staging area off of Central Expressway at Farley Street.  Egress will occur south of South Shoreline Boulevard back onto the Central Expressway. </p>.
