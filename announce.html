		<h4>Senior Transportation in Santa Clara County</h4>
        <p><figure><img src="img/seniorsurvey.jpg"></figure>Santa Clara County is currently conducting a transportation needs assessment focused on a few key populations which currently receive some transportation services or support. The needs assessment will be used to guide and improve future service and improvements to the transportation services that the County provides and support (for example, when, to whom, and how the County provides bus passes or taxi vouchers).</p>
		<p>The 5-minute survey is available in English, Spanish, Chinese, and Vietnamese at: <a href="https://tinyURL.com/TransportationSCC" target="_blank">tinyURL.com/TransportationSCC</a></p>
		<h4>Immigrant Resources Needs and Assets Survey - How do immigrants experience Mountain View?</h4>
        <p>The Human Relations Commission (HRC) Immigrant Needs and Assets survey is now live. The survey aims to gather information from immigrants who live or work in Mountain View. By “immigrants,” we are referring to: People who were not born in the United States AND who were not assigned U.S. citizenship at birth AND who have moved to the U.S. intending to live here. The survey will NOT ask about U.S. citizenship or documentation status. Survey responses are anonymous and are available in English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Russian. Participation is voluntary. Summary findings will be shared publicly later in 2019 and will inform a report to the City Council. The survey will be available until October 4, 2019.</p>
