		<h4 id="caltrain">Caltrain Electrification</h4>
		<p>In Summer 2018, Caltrain began performing work along the railroad corridor in Mountain View. </p>
		<p>The activities during this time included locating underground utilities, testing soil conditions, inspecting signal/communication equipment, potholing, and pruning/removing trees in preparation for the installation and operation of the Overhead Contact System that will power electric trains. </p>
		<p>Caltrain crews will be extending the existing set-out track approximately 500 feet in order to accommodate on-track equipment required for Caltrain Electrification.  The current set-out track is between Farley Street and South Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View.  Construction will require a staging area for foundation installation, pole installation, construction material and pole delivery and storage as well as for loading and unloading of train cars. The loading and unloading of construction train cars and equipment will require the use of trucks, loading of construction trains and occasional use of backup alarms. Staging is expected to begin in October 2019 with construction occurring over a 8-12 month period. </p>
		<p>Vehicles will enter the staging area off of Central Expressway at Farley Street.  Egress will occur south of South Shoreline Boulevard back onto the Central Expressway. </p>.

		<h4 id="stateleg">New State Legislation</h4>
		<p>The California state legislature has adopted several bills that went into effect on January 1, 2020. A nice summary of several new laws is <a href="https://laist.com/2019/12/27/californias_new_laws_starting_jan_1_2020.php" target="_blank">available here</a>. </p>
		<p>Many of these laws are quite consequential, but particularly noteworthy are AB 1482 and SB 329. AB 1482 enacts a statewide rent cap (allowing annual rent increases no greater than 5% plus inflation) and prohibits landlords from evicting tenants without just cause. <b>It is important to keep in mind that the state law allow cities to enact stronger renter protections.</b> Renters in the City of Mountain View are protected by the Community Stabilization and Fair Rent Act (CSFRA), also known as Measure V. <a href="https://www.mountainview.gov/depts/comdev/preservation/rentstabilization/default.asp" target="_blank">More information about CSFRA is available here.</a> </p>
		<p>SB 329 prohibits discrimination against tenants with housing vouchers.</p>
