      <div class="inner">
          <p>In keeping with our city's convention, I won't be endorsing any candidate for Council, nor will I attend any events organized by any Council campaign. However, I recognize that the pandemic impedes the ability to reach out to voters individually, and I know many residents appreciate the opportunity to meet candidates in person and ask questions. Therefore, I have offered to the candidates to share any meet-and-greets on this page and through my other communication channels.  </p>

		<h4 id="caltrain">Caltrain Electrification</h4>
		<p>In Summer 2018, Caltrain began performing work along the railroad corridor in Mountain View. </p>
		<p>The activities during this time included locating underground utilities, testing soil conditions, inspecting signal/communication equipment, potholing, and pruning/removing trees in preparation for the installation and operation of the Overhead Contact System that will power electric trains. </p>
		<p>Caltrain crews will be extending the existing set-out track approximately 500 feet in order to accommodate on-track equipment required for Caltrain Electrification.  The current set-out track is between Farley Street and South Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View.  Construction will require a staging area for foundation installation, pole installation, construction material and pole delivery and storage as well as for loading and unloading of train cars. The loading and unloading of construction train cars and equipment will require the use of trucks, loading of construction trains and occasional use of backup alarms. Staging is expected to begin in October 2019 with construction occurring over a 8-12 month period. </p>
		<p>Vehicles will enter the staging area off of Central Expressway at Farley Street.  Egress will occur south of South Shoreline Boulevard back onto the Central Expressway. </p>.
