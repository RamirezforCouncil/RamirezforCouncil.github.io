		<h4 id="caltrain">Caltrain Electification</h4>
		<p>Please join Caltrain staff for a community meeting about Caltrain Electrification. Staff will provide information about upcoming construction activities that will be occurring in Mountain View.</p>
		<p><b>Meeting Details: </b><br>Thursday, January 23 from 6:00-7:00 p.m. <br>Mountain View City Hall Council Chambers <br>500 Castro St. <br>Mountain View </p>
		<p>Since fall 2018, they have been working on tree pruning/removal, utility relocation, and foundation installation. Over the next few months, crews will continue foundation installation and begin the installation of poles along the rail corridor in Mountain View. The meeting will provide an opportunity for residents to learn more about the project, including the scope and schedule of upcoming construction activities. Please visit <a href="https://calmod.org/get-involved/" target="_blank">www.calmod.org/get-involved</a> to sign-up for weekly construction updates. </p>
		<p>In Summer 2018, Caltrain began performing work along the railroad corridor in Mountain View. </p>
		<p>The activities during this time included locating underground utilities, testing soil conditions, inspecting signal/communication equipment, potholing, and pruning/removing trees in preparation for the installation and operation of the Overhead Contact System that will power electric trains. </p>
		<p>Caltrain crews will be extending the existing set-out track approximately 500 feet in order to accommodate on-track equipment required for Caltrain Electrification.  The current set-out track is between Farley Street and South Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View.  Construction will require a staging area for foundation installation, pole installation, construction material and pole delivery and storage as well as for loading and unloading of train cars. The loading and unloading of construction train cars and equipment will require the use of trucks, loading of construction trains and occasional use of backup alarms. Staging is expected to begin in October 2019 with construction occurring over a 8-12 month period. </p>
		<p>Vehicles will enter the staging area off of Central Expressway at Farley Street.  Egress will occur south of South Shoreline Boulevard back onto the Central Expressway. </p>.

		<h4 id="rapidresponse">Rapid Response Network Trainings in January in Santa Clara County</h4>
		<p>The Rapid Response Network helps to protect our undocumented neighbors from ICE, by showing up to witness and document ICE raids as they occur. When evidence of ICE's unconstitutional tactics is collected, it can help overturn deportation cases. RRN volunteers also search neighborhoods following a raid report to see if ICE is still there, so that we can let people know when they can safely leave their houses again to go to work and school. If you live or work in Santa Clara County, please consider signing up to be a part of the Rapid Response Network. </p>
		<p>Lots more volunteers are needed for this role around the county. The next training in Santa Clara County: </p>

		<h4 id="women">Office of Women’s Policy Civic Engagement Mini-Grants – Round 2 now open!!</h4>
		<p>A second round for applications is open as of December 16, 2019 through February 28, 2020. As part of the commemoration of the upcoming 100th anniversary of the Women’s Suffrage movement, the Santa Clara County Office of Women’s Policy (OWP) will offer $75,000 in mini-grants to Santa Clara County residents who want to organize their communities to promote civic engagement and participatory democracy in honor of the legacy created by the women who fought for the 19th amendment.</p>
		<p>These mini-grants are intended for community members and groups planning activities, events and/or projects promoting democracy as it relates to women’s suffrage and the continuing need for women, girls, and female-identified individuals to actively participate, support, and promote their inclusion in a democratic system. The amount of the mini-grants will range from $200 - $2,000 and will be disbursed to various groups, including individuals, schools, community organizations, and others, to ensure maximum impact as the funding will reach people who are not routinely engaged with County Governments and tend to be missed out when projects meant to foster civic engagement are undertaken. </p>
		<p>Please share the application with all in your networks and community partnerships! Find the link to the application on the <a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/owp/engagement/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Office of Women’s Policy site page</a>. The deadline to submit application is February 28, 2020. These applications are also available in Chinese, Hindi, Khmer, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. </p>
		<p>The outcome of the grant will be to allow residents to deliver the best possible ways to their communities to commemorate the centennial, to honor the legacy of the women who fought 99 years ago to crack open the door to equality, and to develop a collective path that will continue to provide equitable ways for women, girls, and gender expansive individuals identifying as women and girls ways to thrive in our County. </p>
		<p>If there any questions, please contact the Office of Women's Policy (408-678-1400 / 2460 N. 1st Street, Suite 220 | San Jose, California  95131).</p>

		<h4 id="stateleg">New State Legislation</h4>
		<p>The California state legislature has adopted several bills that went into effect on January 1, 2020. A nice summary of several new laws is <a href="https://laist.com/2019/12/27/californias_new_laws_starting_jan_1_2020.php" target="_blank">available here</a>. </p>
		<p>Many of these laws are quite consequential, but particularly noteworthy are AB 1482 and SB 329. AB 1482 enacts a statewide rent cap (allowing annual rent increases no greater than 5% plus inflation) and prohibits landlords from evicting tenants without just cause. <b>It is important to keep in mind that the state law allow cities to enact stronger renter protections.</b> Renters in the City of Mountain View are protected by the Community Stabilization and Fair Rent Act (CSFRA), also known as Measure V. <a href="https://www.mountainview.gov/depts/comdev/preservation/rentstabilization/default.asp" target="_blank">More information about CSFRA is available here.</a> </p>
		<p>SB 329 prohibits discrimination against tenants with housing vouchers.</p>
