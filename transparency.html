	  <h1>Transparency</h1>
	  <p>I am committed to running a clean and transparent campaign. This page provides real-time monetary campaign contribution information with data visualizations. I am also posting my responses to the candidate questionnaires that I have received. <br><br>Although not required, I am electronically filing my Form 460 campaign filing reports. Campaign filing documents can be found on the <a href="http://mountainview.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=19981" target="_blank">city website</a>.</p>

		<h3>Questionnaires</h3>
		<p>Candidates for elective office are regularly invited by different interest groups to participate in endorsement processes that include questionnaires and interviews behind closed doors. The public deserves to know where candidates truly stand on all of the issues. In addition to my <a href="issues">Issues page</a>, I am publishing my responses to the questionnaires I have received as a transparency measure. Because these questionnaires are proprietary, I have requested permission to post them here. You can click below to read or download these documents as each group's endorsement process is completed. Below is a listing of the questionnaires I have completed.</p>
