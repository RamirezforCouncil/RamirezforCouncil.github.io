	      <br><p>Dear Friends,</p>

        <p>It truly is an honor and a privilege to serve you on the Mountain View City Council. I am grateful to have this opportunity to work with you to address the challenges facing our community and to preserve the high quality of life that we enjoy.</p>

        <p>Remaining accessible to you and promoting public participation in local government are among my top priorities. This website is updated frequently to help inform and engage residents and stakeholders. By hosting it on GitHub, I hope to encourage the community to utilize it as a dynamic platform and modify it to ensure that it provides the most useful and up-to-date information.</p>
