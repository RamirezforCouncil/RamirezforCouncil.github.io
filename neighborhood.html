The CNC hosts three to four town hall style meetings each year, rotating through each of the neighborhood areas. Additionally, the CNC administers the Neighborhood Grant Program, which provides funding for block parties, potlucks, and other community-building activities.</p>

        <p>Join a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) by signing up for free training through the City’s Office of Emergency Services. CERT team training prepares local residents to help themselves, their families and neighbors in the event of a disaster. The training covers basic skills that are important to know in a disaster when emergency services may not be available. CERT members receive training in earthquake awareness, disaster fire suppression techniques, disaster medical operations, and light search and rescue, as well as team organization and management. Trained emergency personnel, including firefighters and emergency medical services personnel, teach all classes.</p>
